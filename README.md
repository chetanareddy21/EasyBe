# EasyBe 
"EASYBE" is a data analysis web application. This web application is a user friendly as well as responsive that is implemented using Python’s Streamlit library. This makes it simple and simpler to understand the vast quantity of data that is accessible in the age of new, developing technologies and social activities. It hasthe capacity to swiftly observe user’s dataset and enhance insights. It is to create selfexploratory visualization where it is possible to Explore raw data, see statistical description and visualize the data.

It provide users beautiful and user-friendly visualization features and tools so they may portray their data in a way that is meaningful and clear. This allows users to make their own graphs, such as scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and line plots according to their preferences with their dataset.

Conclusion

The advent of Streamlit Components blurs the line between the Python Data Science ecosystem and the modern frontend ecosystem even more, as it enables us to effortlessly:
Render arbitrary frontend code inside an iFrame in your Streamlit app. This comes with support for hot-reloading during development, pushing for powerful data-driven web applications that combine data manipulation and machine learning in Python with custom interactive visualization; and easily share those newly created components so that other Streamlit users can use them with a single Python call in their own apps!
